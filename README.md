<h1>Hi, I'm Giancarlo!</h1>
I‚Äôm a cybersecurity student at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley with a strong passion for technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. My studies have led me to explore a wide range of topics, from dissecting file systems and analyzing digital evidence to building machine learning models and working with cloud technologies.
Along the way, I‚Äôve developed a solid foundation in computer science, mastering Linux commands, networking, and cryptography while applying these skills to hands-on projects. From investigating file signatures to developing practical tools, I enjoy taking on challenges that push me to think critically and creatively.
My passion for learning is what inspired me to create this GitHub repository‚Äîto share what I‚Äôve learned with others for free. I believe knowledge should be accessible, and I hope this collection of projects helps others who are just as eager to explore cybersecurity and technology.
